# Pipelines for the Cullen Commission Website Repo

These pipelines were extracted from the [Cullen Commission Website Repo](https://github.com/bcgov/jag-cullencommission) to speed up the pipeline process due to the size of the main repo.  The pipeline code was left in the original repo for completeness.
